	<a class="project-bar" id="aboutMe"href="http://caselane.github.io/AboutMePage/AboutMEPAGE.html">My About Me Page</a>
	<p>As an introduction of sorts, my "About Me Page" was my second ever project. If you want more insight on who I am and how I got into web development, or if you just want to see my progression as a front-end web developer, click here.</p>
	<a class="project-bar" id="shakespeare"href="http://caselane.github.io/freshprince/freshprince.html">A Shakespearian Mix on the Theme of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"</a>
	<p>Alas, my first web project. I remember when I did not hold the enlightenment of web development. It would bring a tear to my eye, if this project weren't so basic and crude. If you want to see how far I've come, click here.</p>
	<a class="project-bar" id="NYTimesHack" href="http://caselane.github.io/NYTimesHack/TheTurntTimes.html">My Hack of the New York Times</a>
	<p>My third ever project, this "hack", if you can even call it as such, was my first experience with Chrome Dev Tools, a tool which I now employ in the creation of all of my projects. If you want to see my "turnt" and "fly" html edits to the New York Times page, click here.</p>
	<a class="project-bar" id="karmaImage"href="http://caselane.github.io/fewd_landing_page_clone">My Clone Of A Startup Company, Karma</a>
	<p>This clone was my fourth web project. It served as a tutorial to many elements in css and html, and was also a point in time in which I learned about many third party tools, such as Emmet, ( a download for Sublime Text ) Font Awesome, and others. <a id="this" href="http://thinkful-ed.github.io/karma-clone/">This</a> is the original site, to compare the clone.
